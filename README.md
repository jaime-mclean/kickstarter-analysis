# Analysis of Kickstarter Theater Campaigns

---
## Overview of Project

---
### Purpose

---
This report summarizes data on both successful and failed kickstarter campaigns for plays in the US from May 2009 to March 2017. The project dollar amounts and starting month are tracked to determine the best options for a successfully funded campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

---
The data summarized here is based on actionable, quantifiable variables. The timing of the campaign launch and the monetary campaign goals are straightforward measures of success, but these are not the only factor in the success of a campaign. Unquantifiable data, such as the name of the play and the information provided in the blurb will impact the number of backers, and the level of support backers are willing to provide. 

Not unexpectedly, the succesful campaigns have on average more backers (63 for successful campaigns vs 8 for failed campaigns) and higher average donations ($93 for successful campaigns vs $50 for failed campaigns). While this information is worth noting for monioring the campaign once iut is launched, this is not data that can be acted upon.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
---
The average success rate for all theater campaigns in the US is 61.3%. May has the most campaigns launched in raw counts (166), as well as the most successful campaigns (111) and the highest percentage of successful campaigns (66.9%). December is the worst month to start a campaign, with only 49.3% of the 75 campaigns launched in December being successfully funded. The figure below shows campaign outcomes based on the month the campaign was launched, with May showing the most successful campaign launches. Success rates remain above average through July, then dip below average in August and continue to be at or below average through December and into January.

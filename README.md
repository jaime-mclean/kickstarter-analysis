# Analysis of Kickstarter Theater Campaigns

---
## Overview of Project

---
### Purpose

---
This report summarizes data on both successful and failed kickstarter campaigns for plays in the US from May 2009 to March 2017. The project dollar amounts and starting month are tracked to determine the best options for a successfully funded campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

---
The data summarized here is based on actionable, quantifiable variables. The timing of the campaign launch and the monetary campaign goals are straightforward measures of success, but these are not the only factor in the success of a campaign. Unquantifiable data, such as the name of the play and the information provided in the blurb will impact the number of backers, and the level of support backers are willing to provide. 

Not unexpectedly, the succesful campaigns have on average more backers (63 for successful campaigns vs 8 for failed campaigns) and higher average donations ($93 for successful campaigns vs $50 for failed campaigns). While this information is worth noting for monioring the campaign once iut is launched, this is not data that can be acted upon.
